[Magento 2 Estimated Delivery Date extension](https://plumrocket.com/magento-estimated-delivery-date) allows merchants to display delivery and shipping dates throughout the store (on Product Pages, Category Pages, Shopping Cart  Pages, etc.), in transactional emails, and in the admin panel. You can set unique estimated delivery dates for products and categories, or inherit settings from a parent category.
